A comparative **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** project analyzing **financial sentiment**
using transformer-based models, with a focus on **BERT vs FinBERT** and the impact of
**domain-specific pretraining**.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project presents a **comparative study of BERT and FinBERT** for **financial sentiment classification**.
The task involves classifying financial text into **positive, neutral, and negative sentiment**
using transformer models fine-tuned under identical experimental conditions.

The goal is to evaluate how **domain-adapted language models** perform compared to
general-purpose transformers on financial text.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Perform sentiment analysis on financial text data
- Compare **general-purpose BERT** with **domain-specific FinBERT**
- Evaluate model performance using standard classification metrics
- Analyze the effect of financial-domain pretraining

---

## 🧠 Models Used

### 🔹 BERT
- Model: `bert-base-uncased`
- Pretrained on general-domain corpora
- Used as a baseline transformer model

### 🔹 FinBERT
- Model: `ProsusAI/finbert`
- Pretrained on financial news and reports
- Designed to capture domain-specific financial sentiment

---

## 📂 Datasets

Experiments were conducted using **public financial sentiment datasets**, including:

- **Financial PhraseBank–style data**
  - Financial news headlines and short statements
  - Labels: positive, neutral, negative

- **FiQA-style financial data**
  - Financial questions, reports, and market-related text
  - Labels: positive, neutral, negative

All datasets were **cleaned, normalized, and label-mapped consistently** prior to training.
